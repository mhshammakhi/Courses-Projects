function [totalScores,err_tr]=MLP( X, y,Xtest,hidden_layer_size,epoch)
%% ================ Part 1: Input Pameters ================
% % you should change this                          
testX=Xtest;
lambda = 1;
input_layer_size  = size(X,2);
num_labels = numel(unique(y));          

%% ================ Part 2: Initializing Pameters ================
%  In this part of the exercise, you will be starting to implment a two
%  layer neural network that classifies digits. You will start by
%  implementing a function to initialize the weights of the neural network
%  (randInitializeWeights.m)

initial_Theta1 = randInitializeWeights(input_layer_size, hidden_layer_size);
initial_Theta2 = randInitializeWeights(hidden_layer_size, num_labels);
initial_nn_params = [initial_Theta1(:) ; initial_Theta2(:)];



%% =================== Part 3: Training NN ===================
%  You have now implemented all the code necessary to train a neural 
%  network. To train your neural network, we will now use "fmincg", which
%  is a function which works similarly to "fminunc". Recall that these
%  advanced optimizers are able to train our cost functions efficiently as
%  long as we provide them with the gradient computations.
%
%  After you have completed the assignment, change the MaxIter to a larger
%  value to see how more training helps.
options = optimset('MaxIter', epoch);

%  You should also try different values of lambda


% Create "short hand" for the cost function to be minimized
costFunction = @(p) nnCostFunction(p, ...
                                   input_layer_size, ...
                                   hidden_layer_size, ...
                                   num_labels, X, y, lambda);

% Now, costFunction is a function that takes in only one argument (the
% neural network parameters)

[nn_params, cost] = fmincg(costFunction, initial_nn_params, options);

% Obtain Theta1 and Theta2 back from nn_params
Theta1 = reshape(nn_params(1:hidden_layer_size * (input_layer_size + 1)), ...
                 hidden_layer_size, (input_layer_size + 1));

Theta2 = reshape(nn_params((1 + (hidden_layer_size * (input_layer_size + 1))):end), ...
                 num_labels, (hidden_layer_size + 1));




%% ================= Part 4: Implement Predict =================
%  After training the neural network, we would like to use it to predict
%  the labels. You will now implement the "predict" function to use the
%  neural network to predict the labels of the training set. This lets
%  you compute the training set accuracy.

[~ ,~ , totalScores] = predict(Theta1, Theta2, testX);
[pred ,~ , ~] = predict(Theta1, Theta2, X);
err_tr=mean(pred~=y);

%%This is for checking out each lables vs predict and other scores
