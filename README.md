# MSC Projects and Codes

In my Master (2014-2016), I have done numerous projects in Machine Learning, Statistical Learning, Image Processing and Computer Vision, Deep Learning Signal Processing, and Digital Communication.

In those days there were not these Python modules and MATLAB libraries as well. I have implemented a lot of those algorithms by myself and I developed some of the libraries. Most of them were implemented in MATLAB and Python.

I want to share a few of them and I will upload somehow the others. 
It needs to spend a lot of time to do that. I will continue it depends on the number of views.

some of these projects that were uploaded are:

  - **Advanced Communication:** I uploaded projects which I have done for "Advanced Communication" Course. 

  - **Statistical Learining:** I uploaded assignments and projects which I have done for "Statistical Learning" Course. It contains three subprojects, One paper presentation and The final project files.
