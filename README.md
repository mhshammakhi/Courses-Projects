# MSC Projects and Codes

During my Master's program (2014-2016), I undertook numerous projects encompassing areas such as Machine Learning, Statistical Learning, Image Processing, Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Signal Processing, and Digital Communication.

At that time, the Python modules and MATLAB libraries that exist today were not readily available. Consequently, I personally implemented many of these algorithms and even developed certain libraries myself. The majority of these implementations were carried out using MATLAB and Python.

I am keen to share a few of these projects, and I plan to upload them in some way. However, due to the significant time investment required, I will prioritize based on the number of views and continue accordingly.

Here are some of the projects that have already been uploaded:

  - **Advanced Communication:** I uploaded projects which I have done for "Advanced Communication" Course. 

  - **Statistical Learining:** I uploaded assignments and projects which I have done for "Statistical Learning" Course. It contains three subprojects, One paper presentation and The final project files.
